## What is it?

Given the task of reimagining the classic "game of 15" puzzle in Flutter, we decided to apply one of the key concepts in the framework - composability - to the game itself. 
You can make *literally* any piece of Flutter UI the content of the game without losing interactivity, animations or compromising performance.
Together with fun mechanics, beautiful visuals and 4 carefully selected levels, the game redefines
what's achievable in Flutter.

### Features

- Real-world-inspired puzzle physics (move several tiles at once, snapping, board drift)
- Procedurally-generated initial configurations
- Fully interactive puzzle content
- 4 levels of varying difficulty, selected to reflect some of the Flutter's unique capabilities:
  - Custom Drawer
  - Color Picker
  - Water Ripple
  - AR Cam (not available on web, [why?](#How it works?))

## How it works?

We started the development with simple idea: can we develop a puzzle which can use *any* flutter widget as a content?
